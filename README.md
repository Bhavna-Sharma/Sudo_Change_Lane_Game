# Sudo_Change_Lane_Game

In this project, a game engine was developed using FreeRTOS on NXP LPC1769 board which was interfaced with Arduino board connected to Adafruit OLED. Graphics were set on Arduino IDE; rest of the movements and actions were configured with RTOS using various tasks by connecting the buttons to the LPC1769.
