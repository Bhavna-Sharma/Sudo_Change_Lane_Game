Sudo Change Lane is game bassed on ubuntu operating system.This game is purely based on embedded C by using physical programmable 
circuit board (Arduino microcontroller) which can be easily played on OLED by using a joystick.
In this game, the OLED screen will be divided into 4 sections horizontally:
Section 1(128*10 pixels): This section will be showing the scores gained by the player.
Section 2, Section 3, Section 4 (128*18 pixels each): These sections will be for playing game in which there will be 1 user/player
car which the person playing can move vertically in any one of the lanes/sections out of the three and it will be on the left most
side of the screen, whereas from the right side out of three sections/lanes two enemy cars will be coming randomly in any two 
lanes/sections towards left f the screen leaving one lane empty. This will satisfy the demand of moving objexts from the one side 
of the screen to the another side of the screen.
The basic idea behind the game is that user/player have to change the lane by moving up or down and coming to the empty lane the enemy car is not
get saved from the collision with the enemy cars which are moving from right to left of the screen horizontally.
