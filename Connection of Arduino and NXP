Arduino have a serial port to coomunicate with other devices. In this project, we will use LPC 1769 UART pins.
It will use RX and TX pins of Arduino for the serial communication with LPC1769.
On Uno, Nano, Mini, and Mega, pins 0 and 1 are used for communication with the computer. Connecting anything to these pins can 
interfere with that communication, including causing failed uploads to the board. We have used TX and RX pins of the Arudinor to connect 
with UART pins J10 and J9 of LPC 1769.
For the refrence this is the example performed on the NXP for the tramission vua UART.
UART transmission from LPC1769 working (checked with minicom on host machine)
USB-TTL cable BLACK goes to LPC1769 GROUND

USB-TTL cable BROWN goes to LPC1769 3.3V (may not be necessary, but try it)

USB-TTL cable RED is 5V from USB and so MUST NOT BE CONNECTED (leave floating)

USB-TTL cable ORANGE goes to LPC1769 J2-10

USB-TTL cable YELLOW goes to LPC1769 J2-9

USB-TTL cable GREEN is NOT CONNECTED
